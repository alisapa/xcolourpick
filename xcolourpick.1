.SH DESCRIPTION

xcolourpick captures the mouse pointer. When mouse button 1 is pressed, it
prints out the colour of the pixel at the cursor position. Unless the
.B \-\-multiple
option has been set, it exits after that.

When mouse button 3 is pressed, it opens the magnifier, which makes the 17x17
area around the cursor 4 times larger. To move the magnifier, press mouse
button 3 in a different location.

When any other mouse button is pressed, it exits without printing anything.

Usually, mouse button 1 is the left mouse button and mouse button 3 is the
right mouse button.

.SH OPTIONS

Each short-form option is simply an abbreviation for the long-form option that
begins with the same letter, and therefore not described here.

.TP 
.B --decimal
Print the colour as decimal tuple, rather than as six hexadecimal characters.
For example, an orange colour might be printed without this option as
.IR ff8000 ,
and with this option as
.IR "255 128 0" .

.TP
.B --multiple
Don't exit after mouse button 1 is pressed. Allows for picking more than one
colour.

.TP
.B --help
Print help message and exit.

.SH EXAMPLES

.TP
.B xcolourpick

.TP
.B xcolourpick | xmessage -file -

Pipes the output into
.MR xmessage 1
rather than printing it on the terminal.
